#+title: detangled

* Prototype
the prototype is a front end application that can take as input a yaml pasted in a text area box and shows it as an explorable graph. The graph is navigated in a unique way.
** yaml format
detangled yaml represents an array of node objects with optional parent references. eg
#+begin_src yaml
meta:
  title: A Node graph
  description: |
    some desc
nodes:
 node1:
   title: Node 1
   short_title: node1
   emoji: "\uD83D\uDCA1"
   content: |
    node 1 content...
   parents: []
  node2:
    title: Node 2
    short_title: node2
    content: |
      node 2 content
    parents: [node1, node3]
  node 3:
    title: Node 3
    short_title: node3
    content: |
      node 3 content
#+end_src
** Main UI
*** DONE it resembles the rough diagram in  detangled-concept.png .
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE there's a menu button (with some kind of graph icon) that shows the entire top-down graph with the current node marked.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE graph view is the initial view
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE It is optimised for mobile screens and uses a fixed-width on larger screens to resemble the mobile view.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE There are three panes, a slim top pane, a large mid pane and a slim bottom pane
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE THe top pane shows the parents of the current node as circles and a curved edge connects the circles and the mid pane. the numbers of the circles represent the depth of that parent node.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE the bottom pane is similar but shows the outgoing nodes and edges ie. the nodes for which the current node is a parent. the numbers below the circle represent the 'height' of that node.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE the mid pane shows the title and the content of the current node
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE in the middle pane, a set of circle are overlaid, much like a carousel component. swiping left/right will help the user navigate the sibling nodes like a carousel.

*** DONE improve navigation in the details view
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 11:00]
**** [X] swiping or scrolling up/down should load the first child/parent
**** [X] swiping left/right should load the previous/next sibling
**** [X] keyboard arrow keys also supported
*** DONE make the graph view occupy the whole content pane like it's a whole page. It shouldn't be a popup. It should look like a standalone page, that's zoomable and pannable.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 11:00]
*** DONE black and white high-contrast theme
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 11:15]
** home ui
*** DONE the home ui is shown when the app is opened. It has a textbox for pasting the yaml content to be visualised.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE there are also a few examples like a fictional bug RCA, a brief note on the discovery of the lightbulb, napolean's march etc.
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 10:32]
*** DONE logo added to home page
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat 11:20]

** DONE UX improvs
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat]
*** [X] Have a uniform 'header' pane at the top for both graph and details views. It should have a 'back' arrow on the left to take to the home page, a graph icon or a page icon on the right to switch between graph and details views. The title of the whole yaml should be in the middle.
*** [X] In the graph view, give the text labels a background colour of white, so that they look legible even even placed over the edges.
*** [X] For siblings in graph view, alternate label the placement between top and down so that each label gets more 'breathing' space.
** DONE emoji field for nodes
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat]
*** [X] add 'emoji' field to node type — displayed inside circle in graph view, next to title in details view
*** [X] update all examples with appropriate emojis
** DONE markdown support
CLOSED: [2026-02-28 Sat]
*** [X] add support for markdown in the node description
*** [X] improve all examples to leverage markdown support
