    A wide and deep exploration of how modern programming
    languages evolved from the earliest machine codes. This
    graph illustrates the massive branching factor of the
    software world, showing how different philosophies
    (imperative, functional, object-oriented) created
    entirely different lineages of technology.

      In the beginning, there was the hardware.
      Programmers wrote in binary or mnemonic
      Assembly code, tied directly to a specific
      CPU architecture.

      It was fast, but it was unreadable and
      impossible to port between machines.

  fortran:
    title: "FORTRAN (1957)"
    short_title: "FORTRAN"
    emoji: "🧪"
    content: |
      The first high-level language, designed
      specifically for scientific and
      engineering calculations.

      It introduced the concept of the
      "Compiler," allowing humans to write
      formulas instead of memory addresses.

    content: |
      While FORTRAN focused on numbers, John
      McCarthy's LISP focused on symbols and
      lists.

      It founded the **Functional Programming**
      lineage, introducing recursion, garbage
      collection, and the idea that "code is
      data."

  algol:
    title: "ALGOL 60"
    short_title: "ALGOL"
    emoji: "📐"
    content: |
      The "Universal" language that defined
      the block-structured syntax we still
      use today (`begin/end`, `if/then/else`).

      Almost every modern imperative language
      is a "descendant of ALGOL."

  c_lang:
    title: "C (1972)"
    short_title: "C"
    emoji: "🏎️"
    content: |
      Developed at Bell Labs to write the
      UNIX operating system.

      C combined the power of Assembly with
      the structure of ALGOL. It became the
      "portable assembly" of the world.

    content: |
      While C was perfecting the imperative
      style, Smalltalk was perfecting
      **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

      Everything was an object, and objects
      communicated via messages. It inspired
      the GUI and modern IDEs.

    content: |
      Bjarne Stroustrup wanted to add
      Smalltalk-style objects to the
      efficiency of C.

      The result was a massive, complex
      language that powered the desktop
      software revolution of the 90s.

  python:

    emoji: "🐍"
    content: |
      Guido van Rossum designed Python to
      be readable and "fun."

      It inherited from C (for its core)
      and ABC (for its syntax), becoming the
      dominant language for data science and
      automation.

  java:

    short_title: "Java"

      "Write Once, Run Anywhere."

      Java simplified C++ by removing
      manual memory management (pointers)
      and running on a Virtual Machine (JVM).
      It conquered the enterprise world.

      Created in 10 days for the Netscape
      browser.

      Despite its name, it has more in
      common with LISP and Self than Java.
      It is now the most widely used
      language in the world.

  haskell:
    title: "Haskell (1990)"
    short_title: "Haskell"
    emoji: "λ"
    content: |
      A purely functional language named
      after Haskell Curry.

      It introduced advanced type systems
      (Monads!) and lazy evaluation,
      pushing the boundaries of how we
      reason about programs.

  rust:
    title: "Rust (2010)"
    short_title: "Rust"
    emoji: "🦀"
    content: |
      The modern successor to C++.

      It uses a "Borrow Checker" to provide
      memory safety without a garbage
      collector, merging functional concepts
      with low-level performance.
