  title: "The Convergence of the Smartphone"
  description: |
    A classic example of multiple independent technological
    paths (Telephony, Computing, Media, and Internet)
    converging to create a single, world-changing device.
    This graph shows how the iPhone (2007) wasn't just a
    new phone, but a synthesis of decades of separate
    innovation in completely different industries.

      The path of the radio phone. From
      the massive "brick" phones of the 80s
      to the sleek Nokia 3310.

      This lineage focused on voice
      quality, battery life, and
      cellular signal handoffs.

      Early attempts to merge telephony
      and computing. Great for email
      and calendars, but they were clunky
      and had tiny physical keyboards.

      ### The Great Convergence
      Steve Jobs famously introduced it
      as "A widescreen iPod with touch
      controls, a revolutionary mobile
      phone, and a breakthrough internet
      communications device."

      It was the first time all four
      paths—Phones, Computers, Media Players,
      and the Web—merged into a single,
      touch-driven device.
