  title: "The Life and Death of Stars"
  description: |
    A graph that begins linearly as all stars form from
    gas clouds, but then branches wildly based on a
    single variable: Mass. This illustrates how a
    shared starting point can lead to vastly different
    outcomes—from a quiet white dwarf to a reality-warping
    black hole.

      Giant Molecular Clouds (Nebulas) of
      hydrogen and dust collapse under
      gravity.

      This phase is universal. Every star
      begins as a cold, dark cloud
      starting to spin and heat up.

      The core temperature reaches
      millions of degrees. Friction and
      pressure create a glowing sphere.

      It's not yet a star, but it's
      gathering mass and preparing for
      fusion.

    content: |
      Nuclear fusion begins. Hydrogen
      fuses into Helium, releasing
      immense energy.

      The star is in a state of
      **Hydrostatic Equilibrium**—gravity
      pulls in, and radiation pressure
      pushes out.

      Stars like our Sun (< 8 solar masses).
      They burn their fuel slowly over
      billions of years.

      When the hydrogen runs out, the
      core collapses and the outer layers
      expand.

    content: |
      Stars (> 8 solar masses). They burn
      furious and fast, exhausting their
      fuel in just millions of years.

      They are the "rock stars" of the
      cosmos—live fast, die young.

      The star expands to 100x its
      original size. It starts fusing
      Helium into Carbon.

      Eventually, it sheds its outer
      layers into space.

    content: |
      The tiny, dense, glowing core that
      remains. No more fusion occurs.

      It will slowly cool over trillions
      of years until it becomes a cold
      Black Dwarf.

    content: |
      The core collapses so violently
      that it rebounds in a massive
      explosion, outshining an entire
      galaxy.

      This explosion creates all the
      heavy elements (Gold, Iron) in
      the universe.

      If the remaining core is between
      1.4 and 3 solar masses, it
      becomes a city-sized ball of
      pure neutrons.

      One teaspoon of this material
      would weigh a billion tons.

    content: |
      If the core is > 3 solar masses,
      not even neutron degeneracy
      can stop the collapse.

      Gravity becomes so strong that
      even light cannot escape. Space
      and time are warped into a
      singularity.
