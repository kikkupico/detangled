  description: |
    Four independent threads—military command networks,
    academic computing, telecommunications research, and
    counterculture hacker ethics—wove together over
    decades to create the internet. This graph shows how
    innovations from completely separate worlds repeatedly
    cross-pollinated, converged at critical moments like
    TCP/IP and the World Wide Web, and then diverged again
    into the modern internet we know today.

      The U.S. Department of Defense funds a network
      to connect research universities. The goal:
      a communications system with **no single point
      of failure** that could survive a nuclear strike.

      The first message sent over ARPANET was "LO"—
      the system crashed before completing "LOGIN."

      Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
      build Unix—an operating system designed to be
      **portable, modular, and shareable**.

      Unlike mainframe OSes, Unix was written in C
      and could run on different hardware. Bell Labs
      distributed the source code to universities,
      planting seeds everywhere.

      Paul Baran (RAND) and Donald Davies (NPL)
      independently invent the same idea: instead
      of dedicating a circuit to each call, **break
      data into packets** and route them independently.

      The telephone companies dismiss the idea as
      absurd. It works anyway.

      At MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, a culture

      authority should be **distrusted**.

      These values will shape every layer of the

      ### The First Great Convergence

      Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn combine military
      networking (ARPANET) with telecom theory
      (packet switching) to create TCP/IP—a
      universal protocol that lets **any network
      talk to any other network**.

      On January 1, 1983 ("Flag Day"), ARPANET
      switches to TCP/IP. The internet is born.

      UC Berkeley takes AT&T's Unix and adds
      networking code funded by DARPA—including
      the **BSD socket API**, which becomes the
      standard way every program talks to the
      internet.

      Military money + academic OS = the
      networking stack we still use today.

      Two Duke grad students create a system for

      large-scale **public discussion forum**—
      unmoderated, decentralized, and chaotic.

      It proves that people will use networks
      for conversation, not just computation.

      The internet is growing too fast for a

      invents the **Domain Name System**—a
      distributed database that maps human-readable
      names to IP addresses.

      It's the internet's phone book, and it
      runs on the principle that no single
      authority should control all names.

      Richard Stallman, frustrated that software

      project to build a **completely free**
      operating system.

      He writes the GPL license: you can use,
      modify, and share the code, but you must
      pass those freedoms along. Hacker ethics
      become legally enforceable.

      Email predates the internet—it started as

      By 1989, email is the reason most
      organizations connect to the internet.

      ### The Second Great Convergence

      Tim Berners-Lee at CERN combines DNS
      (addressable names), TCP/IP (universal
      transport), and the hacker ethos of open
      standards to create HTML, HTTP, and URLs.

      He makes a fateful choice: **no patent,
      no license, no fee.** The web is free.

      system (just a hobby)."

      He combines GNU's free tools with his own
      kernel. Distributed via Usenet and FTP,
      developed by volunteers worldwide, Linux
      becomes the OS that **runs the internet**.

      Social networks, cloud computing, and

      Every layer still carries its origins:
      military resilience in the protocols,
      academic openness in the standards,
      telecom engineering in the infrastructure,
      and hacker ethics in the culture—even
      as all four are under constant tension.
