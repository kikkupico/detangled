  title: "Unraveling DNA"
  description: |
    The discovery of DNA's structure was not one eureka
    moment—it was four independent threads of research
    (genetics, biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, and
    bacteriology) that converged over decades. This graph
    traces how each thread contributed essential pieces,
    how they came together in Watson and Crick's 1953
    model, and how the discovery diverged into the
    technologies that define modern biology.

      Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian friar, crosses
      thousands of pea plants and discovers that
      traits are inherited in **discrete units**
      (later called genes) that follow mathematical
      ratios.

      His work is published, ignored for 35 years,
      then rediscovered in 1900. The concept of a
      "unit of heredity" is born—but nobody knows
      what it's made of.

      Friedrich Miescher isolates a strange,
      phosphorus-rich substance from the nuclei
      of white blood cells in used surgical
      bandages. He calls it **"nuclein."**

      It's clearly important—it's in every cell
      nucleus—but nobody knows what it does.
      For decades, proteins are assumed to carry
      heredity because they're more complex.

      Max von Laue discovers that X-rays scatter
      off crystal lattices in patterns that reveal
      atomic structure. William and Lawrence Bragg
      turn this into a practical technique.

      It's a tool for physicists and chemists—
      nobody is thinking about biology yet. But
      this technique will eventually crack open
      the secret of life.

      Frederick Griffith discovers something
      bizarre: dead bacteria can **transform**
      living bacteria, passing on new traits.
      He calls it the "transforming principle."

      Something in the dead cells carries
      hereditary information and can be absorbed
      by living cells. But what is it?

      Thomas Hunt Morgan's fruit fly lab at

      heredity" are physically located on
      **chromosomes**—long structures visible
      under a microscope.

      Chromosomes are made of protein and DNA.
      Most scientists bet on protein as the
      hereditary molecule. They're wrong.

      Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn
      McCarty repeat Griffith's experiment with
      ruthless precision. They systematically
      destroy each component of the dead bacteria
      to find the "transforming principle."

      Destroy the protein? Transformation still
      works. Destroy the RNA? Still works.
      Destroy the **DNA**? Transformation stops.

      **DNA is the molecule of heredity.** The
      scientific establishment resists this
      conclusion for nearly a decade.

      Erwin Chargaff, convinced by Avery's work,
      analyzes DNA from dozens of species. He
      finds a strange pattern: the amount of
      adenine (A) always equals thymine (T), and
      guanine (G) always equals cytosine (C).

      **A=T, G=C.** Nobody knows why.

      This is the crucial clue—it means the
      bases pair up. But Chargaff himself never
      figures out the structure.

      Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase use
      radioactive labels to track what happens
      when viruses infect bacteria. The viral
      **DNA** enters the cell; the viral
      **protein** stays outside.

      This finally convinces the holdouts:
      DNA, not protein, carries genetic
      information. The race to solve its
      structure begins in earnest.

      image of DNA ever taken. The X-shaped
      pattern reveals that DNA is a **helix**
      with specific, measurable dimensions.

      Franklin is methodical—she wants more

      take a different approach: instead of pure
      experiment, they build **physical models**
      of possible DNA structures using metal
      plates and clamps.

      Their first attempt (a triple helix) is
      embarrassingly wrong. Franklin points out
      the errors. They go back to the drawing
      board.

      ### The Great Convergence

      Watson and Crick combine everything:
      - **Chargaff's rules** (A=T, G=C) explain
        base pairing across two strands
      - **Photo 51** gives the helix dimensions
      - **Model building** reveals how the pieces
        physically fit

      On February 28, 1953, they walk into the
      Eagle pub and announce they have "found
      the secret of life." Their model is
      published in *Nature* on April 25, 1953.

      actually **encode** information? Marshall
      Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana crack the
      genetic code: three-letter "codons" of
      DNA bases map to specific amino acids.

      64 codons, 20 amino acids. The code is
      universal—the same in bacteria, oak trees,
      and humans. Life runs on one language.

      human DNA. The result: humans have only
      ~20,000 genes—fewer than a grape.

      The real surprise is how much DNA **doesn't**
      code for proteins. The "junk DNA" turns out
      to be regulatory—switches that control when
      and where genes activate.
